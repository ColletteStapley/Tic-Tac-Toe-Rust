# Overview

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe program written in the Rust Language.

Tic-Tac-Toe uses a stuct and many functions, as well as a  list of Strings, to create a two player interactable short game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

I wrote this code in the hopes of learning Rust. Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple program that I have duplicated many times. I've found that it is a very good base program to figure out a lot of base sytax for many languages.

Below would Normally be a link to a Demo video, but It currently doesn't lead anywhere as I was unable to get the code working yet, or do the Video.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code, C++ visual studio build tools, 

The Rust Extension Pack, and Rust Test Explorer, as well as a Windows Debugger.

# Future Work

* Fix whatever issue is being caused by the confusing mod.rs file
* Maybe Improve how the endgame is determined?
* There are parts of it that work but I don't understand how. Learning that would be great.
